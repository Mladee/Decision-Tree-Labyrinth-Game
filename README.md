# Decision-Tree-Labyrinth-Game

### Game Logic

This game uses Decision Trees to make the enemy AI update itself during the game.My idea was that during the first 5 seconds of the game, the AI uses a manually built decision tree for movement, in which time it learns the movement of the player, and after the first 5 seconds pass, the enemies update themselves and chase the player faster.
